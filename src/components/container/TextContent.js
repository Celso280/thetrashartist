        Ecology being at the forefront of thought has generated a flush of artistic interpretation. For centuries artists have participated in the recycling of items for their art. It is both a different creative medium, but also a way of raising public awareness about environmental degradation, which is the heart of TheTrashArtist's mission.

        Recycled art is a technique that requires many hours of exploration and experimentation with the materials and their possibilities, as well as time to collect the waste - this is where TheTrashArtist steps in. This type of art is expansive and imaginative. A growing number of artists are committed to this type of upcycling sustainable art.

        We could go so far as to declare a new art form because these works are so innovative, while using materials and objects that were destined for the landfill.

        Art creates awareness, and for that TheTrashArtist partners with Geoge Trembley and Isabelle Fourcade for all their events that have culture, art, craftsmanship, and performance as objectives.

        In fact, the use of this new type of material is recognized today as a new movement. This movement is called various things: Recycled art, Recycl'Art, or even upcycling. This technique uses different materials. Artists do not seek to use the recovered objects for their intended purpose, they are creating something new altogether.

        "Pablo Picasso. He was the first artist to integrate the materials called" rough "into his works. With his painting" Le RÃªve "from 1908, he drew on a cardboard support and pasted a label. Then, in 1912, he recovered a rope to frame his oilcloth "Still life with the cane chair". Later he inserted a handlebar and a bicycle saddle for his sculpture "Cabeza de toro" in 1958."

        He is followed by Arman, a sculptor from Nice who stands out for his accumulations. In fact, he classifies, collects, and reuses the objects found when assembling them. His works to denounce excessive consumption through garbage paintings. It was in the 1960s that he began to be one of the forerunners of this recycled art.

        <div className='font-semibold px-20'>THE ADVANTAGES OF TRANSFORMING WASTE INTO ART</div><br/>
        <p className='px-20'>
        One of the main characteristics of this style is that it's not limited to any discipline, it is represented in all of them. We can find recycled art in a painting, in a sculpture, in haute couture, or in the furniture of a house. Furthermore, environmental values, in terms of recycling and reuse of materials, have as much value as the work of art itself.

        The environmental benefits of recycled art include the reuse and prolongation of useful materials and, as a consequence, the reduction of the amount of waste generated. It takes a lot of creativity and a certain degree of technique to work with these materials. In addition to this, artists who create this type of work should ask themselves some questions before facing the challenge: Will the energy consumed in creating the work be excessive? Are the materials to be used really a waste? What percentage of my work will be made up of waste? Will the work bring an environmental benefit?

        People who buy this type of art not only find the works attractive for their artistic value, but are also motivated to contribute to the well-being of the planet by giving the materials a second life that they would not have otherwise had. This movement is also a very interesting educational tool to raise awareness in society, especially children, about the consequences of our actions on the environment and the importance of recycling.

        <div className='font-semibold px-20'>WHAT IS UPCYCLED ART?</div><br/>
        <p className='px-20'>
        Today's society generates an enormous amount of waste. As a result, recycling has become an essential action to protect the environment. Within this area, two approaches have emerged, downcycling and upcycling. In the former, the destructive cycle is slowed down but the resulting objects lose quality as a result of the process, while in the latter they acquire value thanks to the creative intervention. 

        Just  like us, our waste also deserves a second chance and uprecycling has led to the emergence of an artistic movement known as recycled art - upcycled art or upcycling art - that is currently inspiring many artists around the world with its critical message regarding excessive consumption and environmental pollution.
